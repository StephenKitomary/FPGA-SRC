### Level 7: Virtual Machine
Assembler language is still very limitated. We implement a stack based Virtualmachine (see. nand2tetris Chapter 7+8)
We write virtual machine code:
1. led: read button and output to led.
2. blink: let the led blink.
3. echo: read data from UART-rx and write to UART-tx
Now Virtual machine controlles the led!
