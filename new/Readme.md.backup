This project is about building Hack on real hardware as proposed in Chapter 13 of the course [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) using free and open source hard- and software. 

The project consists of 9 Levels, starting with simple wires and ending at Hack-13, the final implementation of Hack on iCE40 FPGA running JACK compiled code at 100 MHz with 8Kx16bit RAM, 64Kx16Bit PROM, a bootloader to upload programms and a 2.8 Inch Color LCD with 320x240 Pixel.

Finally we will discuss, if Hack-13 is powerfull enough to run serious Jack-Application like Pong and Tetris!?
